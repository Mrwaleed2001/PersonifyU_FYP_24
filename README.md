# PersonifyU_FYP_24
For my final year project at NED University (BE in CIS), I developed "PersonifyU," a RAG-based LLM app that streamlines the MBTI test. It engages students in conversation, reducing assessment time and providing accurate insights and tailored career suggestions. PersonifyU makes personality assessment quick, enjoyable, and impactful.
